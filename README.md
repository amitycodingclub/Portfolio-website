# Portfolio-website
Portfolio sites are vital for freelancers working in the digital age. 
While all freelancers can hand out business cards and certain freelancers, such as photographers, can distribute physical 
portfolios to potential clients, a portfolio website provides a way for any freelancer in any industry to reach more clients on a 
global scale. It also provides a way for you to get creative with the information and intricate details you share about yourself 
and your work.
A portfolio site is an extension of a freelancer’s (or company’s) résumé. It provides a convenient way for potential clients to view 
your work while also allowing you to expand on your skills and services. This, however, isn’t the ultimate purpose of a portfolio website.

The ultimate purpose of a portfolio website is to provide a way for you to land more clients, whether that means freelance work, more clients for your agency or employment at a company. You should decide what you want to accomplish with your website before adding content to it.

Do you want to…

…land more clients as a freelancer?
…land more clients for your agency?
…find employment?
